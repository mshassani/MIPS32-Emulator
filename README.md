# MIPS32 Emulator

A modular implementation of a **MIPS32 Single-Cycle CPU Emulator** written in modern C++.

The goal of this project is to build a complete MIPS32 processor from scratch by implementing every hardware component as an independent C++ module and then integrating them into a working CPU.

This project follows the architecture presented in standard Computer Architecture courses (Patterson & Hennessy).

## Testing

Every module is tested independently before integration.

Current test coverage includes:

- Memory operations
- Register File
- ALU operations
- Instruction decoding
- Control signal generation
- CPU integration (first MVP)

---

## Technologies

- C++17
- CMake
- Assert-based Unit Testing

---

## Goals

- Learn computer architecture through implementation.
- Build a clean, modular, and extensible emulator.
- Simulate the execution of MIPS32 machine instructions.
- Provide a solid foundation for future pipeline and cache implementations.

## Status

**Work in Progress**

The first MVP successfully executes basic R-Type instructions using a complete fetch → decode → execute → write-back cycle.
